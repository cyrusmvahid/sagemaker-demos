    "# Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and tan directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to you're data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms that are optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With native support for bring-you're-own-algorithms and frameworks, Amazon SageMaker offers flexible distributed training options that adjust to you're specific workflows. Deploy a model into a secure and scalable environment by launching it with a single click from teh Amazon SageMaker console. Training and hosting are billed by minutes of usage, with no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker python sdk, is a library that provides the user with the ability to wrap your models in helper classes that can be passed to Amazon SageMaker. The python sdk provides you with the ability to, use Amazon Algorithms, train and deploy your own code (currently MXNet and TensorFlow) using Amazon SagedMaker, and bring your own pre-trained dockertized models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us next take a look at the architecture of SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Amazon SageMaker Work:\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "TRaining workload, for a end-to-end model development includes the following components:\n",
    "- S3 Bucket for the training dataset\n",
    "- Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. Fully managed single tenant EC2 instance.\n",
    "- EC2 cluster for training. (fully managed transparent to developer)\n",
    "- S3 bucket for trained model\n",
    "### Hosting\n",
    "- S3 bucket for model\n",
    "- ECS infrastructure to host a dockerized model (fully managed transparent to developer)\n",

    "- Nodel Endpoints, elastically scalable callable inference endpoints. (fully managed transparent to developer)\n",

In case of Amazon Algorithms this is already completed and instead of using your own training and wrapper code, we simply pull the model from [Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/). During the training process the following steps will happen:\n",
