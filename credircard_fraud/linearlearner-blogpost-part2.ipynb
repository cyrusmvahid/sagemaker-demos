    "# Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and tan directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to you're data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms that are optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With native support for bring-you're-own-algorithms and frameworks, Amazon SageMaker offers flexible distributed training options that adjust to you're specific workflows. Deploy a model into a secure and scalable environment by launching it with a single click from teh Amazon SageMaker console. Training and hosting are billed by minutes of usage, with no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker python sdk, is a library that provides the user with the ability to wrap your models in helper classes that can be passed to Amazon SageMaker. The python sdk provides you with the ability to, use Amazon Algorithms, train and deploy your own code (currently MXNet and TensorFlow) using Amazon SagedMaker, and bring your own pre-trained dockertized models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us next take a look at the architecture of SageMaker.\n",

    "## How does Amazon SageMaker Work:\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "TRaining workload, for a end-to-end model development includes the following components:\n",
    "- S3 Bucket for the training dataset\n",
    "- Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. Fully managed single tenant EC2 instance.\n",
    "- EC2 cluster for training. (fully managed transparent to developer)\n",
    "- S3 bucket for trained model\n",

    "- Nodel Endpoints, elastically scalable callable inference endpoints. (fully managed transparent to developer)\n",

    "2. Train: Training code is wrapped inside sagemaker helper code. In case of Amazon Algorithms this is already completed and instead of using your own training and wrapper code, we simply pull the model from [Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/). During the training process the following steps will happen:\n",
    " 1. A training cluster based on requested specification will be created. \n",
    " Dataset will be streamed to the training cluster\n",
    "    - Authentication and Authorization will be based on execution role of the SageMaker \n",
    " 2. A training job is launched.\n",
    " 3. Data is streamed to the training instances.\n",
    " 4- Hyperparameters are passed to the training model.\n",

We often would like the data to be within a comparable range with the same center and perhaps similar standard diviation, so numerical value ranges would not create bias towards some features. This however is not always the case. For instance if we would like one featire to have a bigger impact, we can simply let it. Below os the box plot from our data set. We can see that apart from 'Time' and 'Amount', the rest of the data is normalized, so I assume Visa wanted 'Time' and 'Amount' to have a much higher impact."

Each of the algorithms implements AmazonAlgorithmsEstimatorBase. For instance LinearLearner is a specific estimator based on this new superclass., however we do not need to use these estimators since genral estimator gives us a uniformed way of calling all dockerized, pre-trained algorithms.

    "Now that we have a trained and saved model, we can venture into creating endpoints. Amazon SageMaker requires a single line of code in order to created a fully managed and elasticlly scalable endpoint environemnt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker takes your model file from the S3 bucket and dockerizes it. It also creates an Amazon [ECS (Amazon Elastic Container Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ecs/) infrastructre, fronted with an [ELB or ElasticLoadBalncer](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elastic-load-balancing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The instances are also members of an [Autoscaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html), meaning that based on the incoming load the number of docker images and underlying EC2 instances can growand shrink dynamically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model hosting and Deployment is independent of how you develop your models, meaning that you do not need to develop your model within Amazon SageMaker or use Amazon Algorithms in order to host your models in Amazon SageMaker. \n",

    "\n",
    "From the class diaram we delved into previously, we can remember that EstimatorBase implements a method called `deploy()`. All the deployment magic happens through a single call to `Estimator.deploy()`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Executing `deploy()` calls `create_model()`. `create_model()` is an abstract method of EstimatorBase and is implemented by its sub-classes. `create_model()` in turn returns a Model object. calling  `deploy()` returns a RealTimePredictor class, that can be in fact deployed to the live environement.\n",
